I2S-control-IP-for-ZYBO-zynq-

This is the I2S control IP which have AXI-I/F.
A implementation examples are contained in this repository. 
The implementation is a simple juke box application with audio 
spectrum analyzer using my DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) IP.
The I2S control IP has been designed with the intention to work 
with Xilinx Zynq-FPGA, but will also work in a different FPGA devices.
